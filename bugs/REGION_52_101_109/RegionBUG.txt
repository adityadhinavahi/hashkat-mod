BUG:  REGION

Error:  52, 101, 109

Hashkat preferentially prefers the zeroth region, and won't configure properly if, for example, 
Region 1 is set up and Region 0 is not.

Hashkat, in a study n_12 random runs of same INFILE, where 100% of population in 2 regions was English (LANG_0)
of Red Ideology (IDEOLOGY_0), and the population of each region was of equal amount.

Hashkat had 100% of MOST POPULAR TWEETS (which is based on retweets) from REGION_0, although it should have been
approximately 50-50 Region_0 and Region_1
