Build test file that runs a preferential agent follow model simulation. The simulation will have followback, unfollowing, and retweeting, with 1000 initial agents increasing by a linear function until there are 100,000 agents. There are 2 regions with English and French speaking agents and an additional region with English and Spanish speaking agents that all have a standard preference class, and 4 agent types (Standard, Celebrity, Bot, and Organization), each with the same add weight but differing agent follow weights and follow rates and tweet rates that are all different functions. Is enabled to run for 100 simulated minutes.
