Build test file that runs a twitter suggest follow model simulation with 'use_barabasi' enabled with 1 barabasi connection and a barabasi_exponent of 2. The simulation will have followback, unfollowing, and retweeting, with 1000 initial agents increasing by 100 agents per simulated minute until there are 100,000 agents. There are also 2 regions with English and French speaking agents that all have a standard preference class, and 4 agent types (Standard, Celebrity, Bot, and Organization), each with the same add weight but differing agent follow weights and tweet rates, with all of their follow rates left to zero, so that they only follow through the barabasi configuration. Is enabled to run for 100 simulated minutes.
