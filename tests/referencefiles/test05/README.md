Build test file that runs a twitter follow model simulation, with varying model weights for each follow model. The simulation will have followback, unfollowing, and retweeting, with 1000 initial agents increasing by a linear function until there are 100,000 agents. There is a low unfollow tweet rate and a high use hashtag probability. There are 2 regions with English and French speaking agents and an additional region with English and Spanish speaking agents that have a 50% chance of having a standard preference class and a 50% chance of having a noretweet preference class. The standard preference class has higher tweet transmission rates. There are also 4 agent types (Standard, Celebrity, Bot, and Organization), each with the same add weight but differing agent follow weights, tweet type weights, and hashtag follow options, and follow rates and tweet rates that are all different functions. Is enabled to run for 100 simulated minutes.
