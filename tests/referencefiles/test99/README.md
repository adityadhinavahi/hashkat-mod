Build test file that runs a hashtag follow model simulation. The simulation will have followback, unfollowing, and retweeting, with 1000 initial agents increasing by a linear function until there are 100,000 agents. There are 2 regions with English and French speaking agents and an additional region with English and Spanish speaking agents that have a 50% chance of having a standard preference class and a 50% chance of having a noretweet preference class. There are also 4 agent types (Standard, Celebrity, Bot, and Organization), each with the same add weight but differing agent follow weights and hashtag follow options, and follow rates and tweet rates that are all different functions. Is enabled to run for 1,000 simulated minutes.
