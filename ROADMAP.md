#Roadmap

- [ ] **1. Enhance the _interactive_mode_ of `#k@`.**
  * Reference: [INTERACT.lua](https://github.com/hashkat/hashkat/blob/master/INTERACT.lua)
  
- [ ] **2. Develop an API (sort of) for `#k@`**
  * This shall be used in the _interactive_mode_
  * Aims to check for the request for after each "n" iterations, query and send back results
  * Planned to be implemened using Python
  * Reference: [API_plans.md](https://github.com/hashkat/hashkat/blob/master/API_plans.md)

- [x] **3. Use HTML and JS to create both a stand-alone Electron app and a web site that can control hashkat, either on the same computer or a server.** 
<br><br>_comment(s)_: Done for now.

- [ ] **4. Create "cool" visualizations for data set generated by the simulations of `#k@`**
  * Reference: [chromeexperiments.com/globe](https://www.chromeexperiments.com/globe)

- [ ] **5. Work upon the `Test_Suite` of `#k@` and include them in the [Travis CI Automated Build for Hashkat](https://travis-ci.org/hashkat/hashkat)**

- [ ] **6. Add new variables to describe an agent's state viz. `susceptibility_to_ideology_change` and `susceptibility_to_music_change` in order to calculate `Rate of persuasion`**
